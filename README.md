1. Changing sample rate
2. Changing RX Frequency
3. Enable/Disable max hold
4. Enable/Disable moving average
5. Changing moving average ratio
6. Changing plot to dB scale
7. PyQT GUI

TODO:
1. Check which plotting way is better (1 or 2)
2. Removing center DC (caused by leak from LO)
3. Expanding the plot dynamically when user clicks "Update settings/start" for the first time
4. Recording spectrum and saving (adding a button)
